            <p><span>(1)</span> The goal of the game is to get the most amount of blocks onto the pyramid within 3 rounds.</p>
            <p><span>(2)</span> When it is your turn, you can either add a block to the ship, or gain 3 more blocks (you refill 3 at a time)</p>
            <p><span>(3)</span> You can have at most 5 blocks. If you have 3 blocks, you cannot refill your shed because your only allowed to refill 3 at a time. Refilling would give you 6, which you can't have. </p>
            <p><span>(4)</span> The ship can have at most 2 blocks. When the ship has at least one block, you have the option to sail the ship to the pyramid</p>
            <p><span>(5)</span></p>
